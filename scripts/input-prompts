# VERBOSE QUERIES - Same intent as earlier questions but with excessive detail
>>> Hi there, I'm working on a radio astronomy project and I was wondering if you could help me out. I need to calculate what the theoretical noise would be for an observation I'm planning. The observation will run for about 4 hours, and I'll be using 16 antennas. The center frequency is 1.4 GHz. Could you help me figure out what the noise level would be?
>>> I've been trying to understand this concept that I keep reading about in papers and textbooks about radio interferometry. It's called W-projection and apparently it's important for wide-field imaging, but I'm not really sure how it actually works. Could you explain the basic principles behind it and why we need to use it when we're doing wide-field observations with telescopes like MeerKAT?
>>> So I'm a complete beginner to radio astronomy, just started my PhD actually, and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the different concepts and terminology. I have a physics background but haven't worked with radio telescopes before. My supervisor mentioned I should start learning about interferometry and data processing. Where would you recommend I begin? What are the fundamental concepts I should understand first?
>>> I need to write some code for my data processing pipeline. Specifically, I need a Python function that can take visibility data from a CASA measurement set file and convert it into an image that I can actually look at and analyze. This would be what I think is called a 'dirty image' before any deconvolution. Can you help me write this function?
>>> I keep seeing this acronym RATT mentioned in South African radio astronomy contexts and papers related to MeerKAT, and I'm curious what it stands for. Is it an organization, a software package, or something else?
